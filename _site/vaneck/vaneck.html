  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Van Eck’s sequence (<a href="https://oeis.org/A181391">A181391</a>) is a recursively defined
sequence which has some interestingly complicated behavior. I heard
about it in the <a href="https://www.numberphile.com">Numberphile</a> video
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etMJxB-igrc"><em>Don’t Know</em></a>.</p>

<p>The first term is 0. Here’s the rule to get the next term: Look at the
previous term. If you’ve seen that number before in the sequence, then
this term is how far back you last saw it. If the previous term has
never occurred before, then this term is a 0.</p>

<p>The first few terms are <code class="highlighter-rouge">0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 1, 6, 0, 5, ...</code></p>

<p>Here’s how the first few steps go:</p>
<ul>
  <li>To get the second term we look back at the first term, which is 0. 0
has never occurred before (since we just started), so the second term
is also 0.</li>
  <li>To get the third term, look back at the previous 0. Now we have seen
a 0 before, just one more step back, so the third term is 1.</li>
  <li>1 is new, so the fourth term is 0.</li>
  <li>We have seen a zero before, two steps, back, so the fifth term is 2.</li>
  <li>And so on…</li>
</ul>

<p>More precisely (quoting the OEIS definition):</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">For n &gt;= 1, if there exists an m &lt; n such that a(m) = a(n), take the
largest such m and set a(n+1) = n-m; otherwise a(n+1) = 0. Start with
a(1)=0.</code></p>

<p>It’s been proven that there are an infinite number of 0s – which
means there are always new numbers which have never occurred before –
but many other questions remain unanswered, such as whether every
number will eventually occur. (See <a href="https://oeis.org/A181391">A181391</a> for lots more
information and references.)</p>

<h3 id="computation">Computation</h3>

<p>To compute Van Eck’s sequence, we have to remember the last position
at which we saw each unique value which has occurred in the
sequence. A few observations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In general it seems that new values occur about every
log<sub>10</sub>(n) terms. So if we want to compute, say,
10<sup>12</sup> terms, we’ll need storage for about 10<sup>12</sup> /
12 values and the most recent position in the sequence where they
occurred.</li>
  <li>Values are not evenly distributed – smaller numbers are
more common, with the frequency of larger values falling off
smoothly.</li>
  <li>It’s easy to see that the Nth term of the sequence must be less than
N, so the number of terms we aim to compute is also
a bound on the size of the values we need to store.</li>
</ul>

<p>For small values, a simple lookup table which contains the last
position at which each value occurred is fast and space-efficient,
because small values are common and so most table entries are
used. Larger values are sparser; there are more numbers which have
never occurred in the sequence, which would mean unused table entries,
and so a hash table becomes more efficient, even though its entries
take (initially) twice as much space since they have to store both the
position and the value.</p>

<p>We can quickly save some space by using only as many bytes as
necessary for our data. 10<sup>12</sup> is a little less than
2<sup>40</sup>, so we can get to a trillion terms using 40-bit
(5-byte) numbers. The C bitfield syntax gives a convenient way to do
this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span class="k">typedef</span> <span class="k">struct</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="kt">unsigned</span> <span class="kt">long</span> <span class="n">position</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="mi">40</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span> <span class="n">__attribute__</span> <span class="p">((</span><span class="n">packed</span><span class="p">))</span> <span class="n">table_entry_t</span><span class="p">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Normally the compiler would pad this struct out to 8 bytes to keep
memory accesses nicely aligned, but the <code class="highlighter-rouge">packed</code> attribute says to
squish them all together. With a modern processor and compiler, the
performance impact is minimal, and well worth saving 37.5% of our
memory.</p>

<p>Likewise, the hash table entry contains two 5-byte integers, for the
value and its last position. With some experimentation we can estimate
a good cutoff for when we switch from the lookup table to the hash –
when the values of the sequence become sparse enough that the lookup
table is less than half utilized.</p>

<h4 id="some-hardware-considerations"><strong>Some hardware considerations</strong></h4>

<p>If you look at sequence, the successive terms have a sort of
“Christmas tree” shape: a 0 is followed by (usually) successively
larger values until there’s a really big one which has never been seen
before, which means the following term is back to 0.</p>

<p>But from the point of view of the processor, they might as well be
random. And since each term is looked up in a giant array or hash to
get the next term, that means a big series of data-dependent random
memory accesses, which is pretty much the worst possible case for
memory performance. The program’s time is going to be dominated by
cache miss and TLB miss (page table walk) latency.</p>

<p>There’s not a whole lot we can do about this, but we can help a bit:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In the hash table, collisions are handled by just scanning linearly
for the next available spot. This isn’t always the best policy –
rehashing to somewhere far away can help avoid pileups and keep
things evenly distributed throughout the table – but it’s good here
because rehashing would probably generate another page miss, and we
can scan a lot of entries in the time that would take.</li>
  <li>Enabling transparent huge pages (THP) on Linux with <code class="highlighter-rouge">sudo hugeadm
--thp-always</code> was worth about a 30% performance improvement. Using
2MB pages instead of 4KB pages will improve TLB hit rates somewhat,
but more importantly it shortens the page walk by one level, and
makes the page tables themselves much smaller so that they don’t
compete so much for cache space with the actual data.</li>
  <li>As soon as we have a term, doing a software prefetch using gcc’s
<code class="highlighter-rouge">__builtin_prefetch()</code> is worth a few more percent. That gets the
next miss started while we do various statistics and bookkeeping on
the current term.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="a-better-hash-table"><strong>A better hash table</strong></h4>

<p>The hash table stores the value as well as the position, so we can
tell whether the entry we’ve found is actually the value we’re looking
for. But if we’re careful about the choice of hash function, we can
know a lot about the value based on where it sits in the hash table.</p>

<p>For instance, say we have a hash table with 2<sup>32</sup> entries. If
our hash function is just <code class="highlighter-rouge">value % (1&lt;&lt;32)</code>, then the index into the
hash table gives us the low 32 bits of the value, and we only need to
store the upper 8 bits.</p>

<p>Of course that only works until you have a collision. Once you put
something in a different location than it originally hashed to, you’ve
lost the information about what the original value is. We can fix this
by also storing a small offset, which records how far away this value
is from its desired location in the hash.</p>

<p>For this sequence, a simple mod doesn’t work well as a hash function
because smaller values are more common, so the low end of the hash
table fills up first. To fix that without losing any information about
the value, we can rotate it by a few bits before modding by the hash
size.</p>

<p>Finally, the size of the offset means that there’s a limit on how many
collisions we can have in a row when inserting a value. To get around
this, if we reach the collision limit (2<sup>offset_size</sup>
occupied entries in a row) then we fall back on a small secondary hash
table which stores the full value and position.</p>

<p>The size of the hash table determines how many bits of the value you
can extract from the hash index, and thus how many upper bits have to
be stored in the hash entry. With a hash table of over 2<sup>36</sup>
entries, we can use this structure:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span class="k">typedef</span> <span class="k">struct</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="kt">unsigned</span> <span class="kt">long</span> <span class="n">position</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="mi">40</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="kt">unsigned</span> <span class="kt">long</span> <span class="n">upper_value</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="kt">unsigned</span> <span class="kt">long</span> <span class="n">offset</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="mi">12</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span> <span class="n">__attribute__</span> <span class="p">((</span><span class="n">packed</span><span class="p">))</span> <span class="n">hash_entry_t</span><span class="p">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This is only 7 bytes – a significant improvement over the 10 bytes we
started with.</p>

<h3 id="results">Results</h3>

<p>My home machine has 128GB of memory, with which I was able to reach
about 210 billion terms, storing 19.7 billion value/position
pairs. But I really wanted to reach 1 trillion, so I ventured into
<a href="https://cloud.google.com/">Google Cloud</a> for the first time.</p>

<p>The ‘ultramem’ class of machines offers really large memory sizes, up
to 3.8TB. Allowing your job to be pre-empted reduces the price by
about 80%, but you could get kicked off any time, and there’s a
24-hour maximum.</p>

<p>So I gambled… and won! Using a machine with 960GB of memory, I made
it the full 24 hours without getting bumped, and hit the 1 trillion
mark with just 6 minutes to spare.</p>

<p>After 10^12 terms, there have been 90689534032 zeros (which equate to
unique values), and the smallest number not appearing is 1732029957.
And I got some nice graphs of the long-term behavior:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://oeis.org/A181391/a181391_3.png">Frequency of values 0..500 over the first 10^12 terms</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://oeis.org/A181391/a181391_4.png">Frequency of values 0..1000000 over the first 10^12 terms</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://oeis.org/A181391/a181391_5.png">Average distance between 0s over the first 10^12 terms</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Overall the computation didn’t really produce any surprising results,
but it was a lot of fun, and the space-saving hash table technique and
knowing how to rent a cloud machine will surely be useful again.</p>
