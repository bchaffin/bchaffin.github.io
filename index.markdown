I like to use computers to play with fun math problems. This page has
notes on some of my projects, for those very few who may be
interested. (And so I can remember them.)

If you have any fresh insight into any of these puzzles, I'd love to
hear about it! You can reach me at chaffin (at) gmail (dot) com.

## OEIS sequences

The [Online Encylopedia of Integer Sequences](http://oeis.org) is an
endless source of fun projects.
