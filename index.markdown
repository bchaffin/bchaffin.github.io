I like to use computers to play with fun math problems. This page has
notes on some of my projects, for those very few who may be
interested. (And so I can remember them.)

If you have any fresh insight into any of these puzzles, I'd love to
hear about it! You can reach me at chaffin (at) gmail (dot) com.

endless source of fun projects.
